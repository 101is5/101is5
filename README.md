Cheers, community!

I'm Heleno("elleno"), a soon-to-be-officially-dev on a daily journey 
of improving while hunting a job. 

I've got a website cooking in Django but, for the time being, you can
browse around everything I've dived into so far.

Most of my studies are heavily commented, so chances are there's that 
peculiar approach you might find helpful!
